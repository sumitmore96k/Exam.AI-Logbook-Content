Week 7: Extension of Question Generator for Descriptive Questions
Building upon the MCQ generator, we worked this week on expanding the system to also generate descriptive questions.
We developed new templates suitable for short-answer and long-answer questions â€” e.g., "Explain the concept of ___ in your own words" or "Discuss the importance of ___ with examples."

The backend logic was enhanced to handle descriptive question generation using both manual templates and small AI models for rephrasing topics into open-ended questions.

We added parameters for difficulty level, estimated word count, and topic specificity to make the generated descriptive questions more useful for teachers.

The admin interface was also updated to allow viewing, editing, and categorizing descriptive questions.

Outcome:

Descriptive question generation logic implemented.

Enhanced admin panel to support multiple question types.

Categorization based on difficulty and topic added.
