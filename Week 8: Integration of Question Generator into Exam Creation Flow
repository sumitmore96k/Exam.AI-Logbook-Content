Week 8: Integration of Question Generator into Exam Creation Flow
In Week 8, we completed the integration of the Question Generator into the main exam creation module.
Now, when creating an exam (objective or descriptive), admins can directly use the generator to auto-populate questions based on selected topics and difficulty levels.

We added options to regenerate questions, edit them manually, and mix generated questions with manually entered questions.
This made the exam creation process much faster and more dynamic for professors.

We also did initial testing of the generator by creating sample exams and analyzing the quality and relevance of generated questions.

Outcome:

Question generator fully integrated with exam creation workflow.

Admins can create exams faster using generated questions.

Sample exam creation and internal review completed.
