Week 4: Practical Exam System Setup
This weekâ€™s focus was on starting the practical exam module.
We researched different methods for handling practical exams, such as live code editor integration (e.g., using Monaco Editor) and secure file upload mechanisms for project-based exams.

The backend was updated to allow large file uploads and submissions with multiple files if needed. We also designed the practical exam flow, including instructions page, assignment details, code/file upload interface, and final submission.

On the frontend, we built a basic prototype screen where students could write code, upload project files, and submit them easily. Error handling and confirmation prompts were added to ensure a smooth user experience.

Outcome:

Practical exam backend designed for code/file submissions.

Frontend prototype for practical exam flow created.

Research completed for code editor integration options.
