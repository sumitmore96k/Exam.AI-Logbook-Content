Week 5: Backend Development for Practical Exams
Continuing from Week 4, we moved deeper into backend development for the practical exams.
We finalized the API routes for practical exam assignment retrieval, file/code submission, and evaluation status updates.

Security measures like file type validation, submission deadlines, and plagiarism detection (basic checks) were discussed and partially implemented.
We also enhanced the frontend interface for practical exams by adding drag-and-drop upload support, syntax highlighting in the code editor, and preview options for submitted files.

Simultaneously, we started drafting documentation for professors on how to create practical assignments and view submissions.

Outcome:

Practical exam submission flow (backend + frontend) completed.

Security and validation measures implemented.

Practical exam documentation (draft version) created for internal review.
