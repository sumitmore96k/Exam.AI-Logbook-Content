Week 11: Final Polishing and Feedback Incorporation
This week, we polished the system based on internal testing feedback.

We made small but impactful improvements such as:

Faster loading of exam questions.

Instant save notification after each answer update.

Auto-scroll and focus improvements in long exams.

We also finalized the Question Generator by improving the quality of generated questions and adding filters based on keywords.

Additionally, we shared the platform with a small group of test professors and students and collected feedback.
Minor UX tweaks (like improved back buttons, clearer progress bars, etc.) were done based on their suggestions.

Outcome:

Final polish and optimizations completed.

External feedback collected and addressed.

System ready for full integration testing.
