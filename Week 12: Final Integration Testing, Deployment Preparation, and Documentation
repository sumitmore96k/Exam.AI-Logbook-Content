Week 12: Final Integration Testing, Deployment Preparation, and Documentation
In the final week, we focused on full system integration testing to ensure that all newly developed modules — objective exams, descriptive exams, practical exams, and the question generator — were working seamlessly together.

We performed thorough testing across different user roles (students, professors, admins), different devices, and various network conditions. Special scenarios like exam submission failures, timeouts, and re-attempts were also tested.

Alongside testing, we prepared for deployment:

Optimized the backend and database for better performance and security.

Conducted code clean-up and documentation updates.

Created user manuals and tutorial videos for professors and students to understand how to use the new features.

We also finalized a demo presentation to showcase the new additions and improvements in Exam.ai.

Outcome:

Full system integration tested and passed.

Deployment-ready build created.

Documentation, manuals, and demo materials completed.
