Week 3: Development of Descriptive Exam Module
This week, we continued working on the descriptive exam feature.
We completed the core backend APIs to handle descriptive question retrieval, answer saving, and final submission. We added validations like minimum/maximum word limits and auto-save functionality to prevent data loss during long writing sessions.

On the frontend, we developed the descriptive exam UI â€” including a clean text editor, timer integration, and navigation between questions. We also added functionality for students to review their answers before final submission.

Additionally, we created an admin view where professors can see submitted descriptive answers, and mark them manually with optional comments.

Outcome:

Backend and frontend flow for descriptive exams completed.

Manual evaluation panel for professors implemented.

Descriptive exam module ready for internal testing.
