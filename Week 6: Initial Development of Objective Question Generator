Week 6: Initial Development of Objective Question Generator
This week, we shifted focus to building the Question Generator system, starting with objective (MCQ) questions.
We researched different strategies like keyword-based question creation, question templates, and basic AI-assisted question generation models.

The first version of the question generator was implemented using a template-based system â€” where we defined structures like "What is the definition of ___?" or "Which of the following is true about ___?".
Questions were generated dynamically based on inputs like topics, difficulty level, and keywords.

The backend APIs were developed to allow the admin to input a topic and get a set of auto-generated MCQs.
We also created a small frontend tool where admins can review, edit, and accept/reject generated questions before adding them to exams.

Outcome:

First version of MCQ Question Generator completed.

Admin tool for reviewing and editing generated questions built.

Research and strategy for expanding to descriptive questions initiated.
