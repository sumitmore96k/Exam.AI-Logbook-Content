Week 10: Testing and Validation for Descriptive and Practical Exams
This week, we carried out extensive testing for the new exam types (descriptive and practical).

For descriptive exams, we tested scenarios like:

Auto-saving during network issues.

Word limit validations.

Professor manual grading flow.

For practical exams, we tested:

Code editor functionalities.

File upload limits and validation.

Handling of corrupted files and late submissions.

We fixed multiple minor bugs identified during testing, especially related to file uploads, editor crashes, and answer submission edge cases.
A checklist was prepared to ensure all critical features were covered before launch.

Outcome:

Successful internal testing of descriptive and practical exam modules.

Bugs identified and resolved.

Feature validation checklist prepared.
