Week 9: Major UI/UX Overhaul
This week was dedicated to improving the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) of Exam.ai based on feedback and usability studies.

We redesigned the navigation flow to make switching between different exam types (objective, descriptive, practical) smoother.
The exam-taking interface was made cleaner with better use of spacing, font hierarchy, and minimal distractions to help students focus.

Special attention was given to mobile responsiveness, ensuring the platform worked equally well on tablets and phones.
Animations and micro-interactions were introduced for smoother transitions between questions and screens.

New consistent color schemes, button styles, and error/success messages were also standardized across the application.

Outcome:

Complete redesign of exam UI/UX.

Improved mobile/tablet compatibility.

Enhanced readability and navigation flow for users.
